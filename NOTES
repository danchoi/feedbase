This will be the feed aggregator engine for Kindlefeeder, but also
usable for other projects.

PostgreSQL

db/create.sql

Create a database called 'feeds'

? rchardet https://rubygems.org/gems/edouard-rchardet

API

  FetchFeed.from_url [feed-url]

  takes care of getting the feed, parsing, and storing in postgres

Next step is to rebuild the Rails app around this.

Users
Subscriptions
Schedule

What's the most conservative way of doing this?

Keep MySQL and the schema, 

Payload generator is a discrete part. Refactor this. and keep the middle 

bin/payload_generator2 is not used any more. Feeds are fetched in
lib/feed_couch.rb #refresh method. It doesn't seem this refresh method
can handle https

RelaxedPayloadGenerator is the key class used by Delivery.

Payload Specification can be turned into a TABLE and Model. Or the
fields can be added to delivery as discrete fields (instead of blob);

TODO. 
- Check ETag when updating feed.
- private password feeds as user requested
- NEW MOBI generation; periodical format
- migrate feeds from MySQL to Postgresql
  - check new feed creation
- clean up rails; move to rails 3; put into git; simplify deployment

postgresql functions
curval()
setval()

I can perhaps sync the feed_id of this table with feeds.id in the rails
database?

We need to change the unique constraint on items to be over (feed_id, guid) and
not over (guid) only.


feeds=# \d items
                                        Table "public.items"
   Column   |            Type             |                        Modifiers
------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------
 item_id    | integer                     | not null default nextval('items_item_id_seq'::regclass)

    "items_guid_key" UNIQUE, btree (guid)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "items_feed_id_fkey" FOREIGN KEY (feed_id) REFERENCES feeds(feed_id) ON DELETE CASCADE

alter table items add constraint items_guid_feed_id_key UNIQUE (guid, feed_id);
alter table items drop constraint items_guid_key;
